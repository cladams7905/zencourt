## Relocators & Job Transferees

### Psychology Profile

**Who they are:** Ages 28-55, moving to new city for career opportunity, corporate transfer, or life change. May have relocation package or be self-funding. Timeline is compressed (often 30-90 days). Starting from zero local knowledge—need to become experts in weeks, not years.

**Core pain points:**

- Impossible timeline—find home in unfamiliar city while still working current job
- Information asymmetry—locals have years of knowledge they don't have
- Remote decision-making—may buy based on video tours alone
- Neighborhood roulette anxiety—fear of choosing wrong area
- Dual transaction complexity—often selling in origin market simultaneously
- Family disruption guilt—uprooting spouse and children
- Cost of living recalibration—expectations may not match new market

**Emotional drivers:** Excitement mixed with terror, desire to establish stability quickly, protecting family, professional identity advancement, control-seeking amid uncertainty, deep need for trustworthy local guidance.

**Decision style:** Time-compressed, research-intensive but efficient, high trust-dependency once earned, comparative (constantly referencing origin city), pragmatic about compromises.

### Content Strategy

**Tone:** Reassuring and competent. Locally authoritative. Efficient and organized. Empathetic to stress. Proactively informative.

**Content pillars:**

1. Area intelligence & orientation (35%) — Neighborhood guides, commute analysis, schools, cost of living
2. Relocation logistics (25%) — Remote buying process, timeline planning, temporary housing
3. Market comparison (20%) — Origin vs. destination, budget recalibration, pace and competition
4. Community integration (20%) — What it's like to live here, settling in, making connections

**Hooks that work:** "Moving to [destination]? Here's what you need to know", "If you're relocating from [origin city], watch this", "Buying remotely? Here's how to do it right", "The neighborhoods I recommend for [situation]"

**Avoid:** Assuming any local knowledge, information without origin-city context, ignoring emotional difficulty, generic relocation content, unavailability across time zones.

### Key Topics

Best neighborhoods for families/professionals, commute times, school district comparison, cost of living comparison, remote home buying, virtual tours, relocation timeline, temporary housing, corporate relocation, rent vs buy decision, settling in, finding doctors, making friends, newcomer groups

### Data Emphasis

Always provide origin-city comparisons ("Coming from [X], your budget gets you [Y] here"). Lead with market pace—how fast must they move? Show neighborhood-specific pricing. Address timeline feasibility directly. Be their "borrowed local knowledge."
