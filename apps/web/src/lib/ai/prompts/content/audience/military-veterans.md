## Military & Veterans

### Psychology Profile

**Who they are:** Ages 22-55+, active duty, reserves, Guard, veterans, and military retirees with VA loan eligibility. Subject to PCS moves every 2-4 years (active duty). Concentrated near military installations. Income varies by rank ($35K-$150K+). BAH (housing allowance) is central to affordability thinking.

**Core pain points:**

- PCS uncertainty—orders can come anytime, buying feels risky
- VA loan misconceptions—fighting stigma that VA offers are inferior
- Compressed timelines—PCS orders come with tight report dates
- Equity frustration—frequent moves prevented wealth building
- Deployment complications—may need to transact while spouse is deployed
- Finding military-competent agents—too many claim VA expertise but don't have it
- Competing in hot markets—worry VA offers won't win

**Emotional drivers:** Stability craving after years of transience, earned benefit pride (VA loan is earned through service), protecting family, finally building wealth, post-service identity establishment.

**Decision style:** Mission-oriented, direct communication preference, trust-but-verify, adaptable to incomplete information, family-centric, benefits-conscious.

### Content Strategy

**Tone:** Direct and respectful. Knowledgeable about military life (PCS, BAH, deployment). Advocate positioning. No performative "thank you for your service"—show respect through competence.

**Content pillars:**

1. VA loan mastery (35%) — Process, myths, benefits, appraisal guidance, entitlement
2. Military-specific guidance (25%) — PCS strategy, deployment transactions, BAH optimization
3. Market & location intelligence (25%) — Installation area guides, commute to base, investment potential
4. Transition & veteran life (15%) — Post-service buying, retiree housing, VA benefit restoration

**Hooks that work:** "PCS orders just dropped? Here's your 30-day plan", "The VA loan myth costing military buyers money", "Why your VA offer keeps getting rejected (and how to fix it)", "What BAH actually buys you near [installation]"

**Avoid:** TYFYS pandering without substance, VA loan ignorance, ignoring military spouse role, suggesting they waive VA protections, generic relocation content, unfamiliar military terminology.

### Key Topics

VA loan eligibility, Certificate of Eligibility, VA funding fee, zero down payment, no PMI, VA appraisal, Minimum Property Requirements, PCS home buying, BAH rates, entitlement restoration, IRRRL refinance, military spouse, deployment power of attorney, rent vs buy military, base housing vs off-base

### Data Emphasis

Frame affordability in BAH terms—that's how military buyers think. Provide explicit break-even analysis for expected tour length. Address VA offer competitiveness honestly. Show installation-specific inventory and pricing. Build trust through demonstrated military-life knowledge.
