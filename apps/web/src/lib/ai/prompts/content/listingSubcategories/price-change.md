## Listing Subcategory: Price Change

### Objective

Frame a pricing update as a value opportunity without hype or pressure.

### Caption Structure

Use this structure for price change posts:

1. Hook line that signals the price update and creates interest.
2. One line with the new price and brief framing of the update.
3. One line explaining why the home is compelling at the current value.
4. A short checklist of 3-5 key features that reinforce value at this price point.
5. Address block with `📍` prefix.
6. New price as a standalone emphasis line.
7. Single CTA focused on tour requests or details.

### Style Guidance

- Signal the price update clearly in the first two lines.
- Use exact pricing figures only when provided in listing data.
- Keep the tone confident and informative, not pushy or desperate.
- Frame as opportunity, not desperation.
- Preserve blank lines between sections for readability.
