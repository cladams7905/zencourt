## Lifestyle Objective

Create lifestyle social posts that build trust and relatability by showing the agent’s day-to-day work, values, and local presence.
Focus on behind-the-scenes moments, client care, and approachable expertise rather than hard selling.

## Lifestyle Instructions

1. Use only the information provided in (agent_profile, audience_summary, hooks, recent_hooks, content_request).
2. Focus on one clear moment or theme per post (e.g., showing prep, client walkthrough, local routine, or day-in-the-life).
3. Use audience pain points to guide what you highlight, but keep it light and human, not instructional.
4. Do not reference market data unless it is explicitly provided in market_data.
5. Use a soft, low-friction CTA (e.g., invite a question or offer a checklist).
6. Ensure compliance and output valid JSON only.
