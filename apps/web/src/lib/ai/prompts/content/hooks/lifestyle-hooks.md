## Usage Guidelines

1. **Authenticity is non-negotiable:** This content only works if it's genuine. Staged "day in the life" content that feels fake will backfire. The goal is humanizing, not performing.

2. **Balance personal and professional:** Show personality without oversharing. The audience wants to know you're a real person, not your entire personal life.

3. **Client content needs permission:** Before posting client reactions, celebrations, or stories, always have explicit permission. Consider having a standard release form.

4. **Milestone content should be gracious:** "Celebrating {number} closings" is fine. Humble-bragging or excessive self-congratulation alienates audiences. Thank clients and community.

5. **POV content is highly shareable:** The POV format performs well because it puts the viewer in the experience. Use for aspirational moments (offer accepted, keys in hand).

6. **GRWM is platform-specific:** "Get Ready With Me" content performs best on Instagram Reels and TikTok. Adapt format for platform.

7. **Stories build trust:** "The wildest thing I've seen" or "my biggest mistake" content humanizes you and makes you memorable. Vulnerability (within reason) builds connection.

8. **Local favorites double as community content:** "Where I grab coffee between showings" serves dual purpose, personal brand AND local expertise positioning.

9. **Don't overdo the lifestyle content:** This should be ~15-20% of overall content mix, not the majority. Too much personal content without value dilutes your expert positioning.

10. **Use for relationship, not reach:** Lifestyle content typically gets less reach than educational or market content but builds deeper connection with existing followers. That's the point.

## Platform-Specific Notes

**Instagram Reels/TikTok:**

- Day in the life, GRWM, POV formats perform best
- Keep under 60 seconds for optimal completion rate
- Trending audio can boost reach

**Instagram Stories:**

- Behind the scenes, Q&A, polls work well
- More casual, ephemeral content acceptable
- Use for real-time updates during busy days

**LinkedIn:**

- Career reflections, milestone achievements, lessons learned
- More professional tone, skip outfit content
- Focus on value delivered to clients

**Facebook:**

- Client celebrations, local favorites, community content
- Slightly longer form acceptable
- Strong for relationship-building with existing network
