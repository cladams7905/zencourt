## Usage Guidelines

1. **Feature the property, not yourself:** Even "Just listed!" should immediately pivot to what makes the property special. Avoid agent-centric framing.

2. **Specificity sells:** "${price} in {location}" outperforms "Great home for sale." Always include address, neighborhood, or price point when available.

3. **Match urgency to reality:** Only use scarcity hooks ("Won't last long!") when genuinely warranted by market conditions or showing activity.

4. **Sold posts need insight:** "SOLD!" alone is boring. Add what made it sell, how fast, or what it means for the market to deliver value.

5. **Tours need a star feature:** Don't just tour the whole house. Lead with the one feature that will stop the scroll, the view, the kitchen, the backyard.

6. **Open house hooks need details:** Always include day, time, and address. Make it easy to save and act on.

7. **Price comparisons drive engagement:** "What ${X} gets you" content performs well. Show multiple options or compare neighborhoods at same price point.

8. **Lifestyle over specs:** "Wake up to this view every morning" resonates more than "3 bed, 2 bath, 1,800 sqft."

9. **Combine with global hooks:** Layer listing-specific templates with curiosity formats. Example: "Take a tour of this ${price} home in {city}" combines curiosity with a price anchor.

10. **Respect Fair Housing:** Never mention neighborhood demographics, school quality in coded language, or anything that could be construed as steering.
