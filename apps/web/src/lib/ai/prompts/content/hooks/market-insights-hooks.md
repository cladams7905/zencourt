## Usage Guidelines

1. **Always localize:** Replace `{city}`, `{county}`, `{location}` with actual place names. Generic market content underperforms dramatically.

2. **Use real data:** When using hooks that reference specific numbers (`${amount}`, `{number}`, `{year}`), ensure you have actual data to back the claim. Never fabricate statistics.

3. **Time-stamp appropriately:** Market content has a short shelf life. Hooks referencing `{month}`, `{quarter}`, or `{year}` must reflect current timeframes.

4. **Match data to audience:** Investors want cap rates and ROI. First-time buyers want affordability. Tailor the market angle to the audience directive.

5. **Lead with insight, not just data:** "Home prices up 4%" is boring. "Home prices up 4%, here's what that means for your down payment" is actionable.

6. **Balance optimism and honesty:** Don't spin bad market news. Present reality with context and actionable guidance.

7. **Combine with global hooks:** Layer market-specific templates with curiosity or list formats from global hooks for higher engagement. Example: "5 things this week's market data tells us about {county}" combines list format with market insight.
