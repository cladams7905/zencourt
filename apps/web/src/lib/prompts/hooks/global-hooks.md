2. **Inject specificity:** Generic hooks underperform. Add numbers, neighborhood names, dollar amounts, or timeframes whenever possible.

3. **Match to audience:** A hook that works for first-time buyers may fall flat for investors. Consider the audience's sophistication level and pain points.

4. **Vary your formats:** Don't overuse any single template. Rotate through different hook styles to keep content fresh.

5. **Test the scroll-stop:** Before finalizing, ask: "Would this make ME stop scrolling?" If not, strengthen it.
