## Usage Guidelines

1. **Lead with value, not credentials:** "Here's how to negotiate your offer" beats "As a 10-year agent, let me tell you about negotiating." Demonstrate expertise through content, not claims.

2. **Be specific about the outcome:** "{number} tips for selling faster" is okay. "{number} tips that cut my clients' time on market by 50%" is better.

3. **Match complexity to audience:** Beginner content should be genuinely accessible. Advanced tips should respect their existing knowledge. Use audience directive to calibrate.

4. **Numbered lists perform:** Content with specific numbers (3 tips, 5 mistakes, 7 steps) consistently outperforms vague promises. Be precise.

5. **Mistakes content has high engagement:** People are loss-averse. "Mistakes to avoid" often outperforms "tips to follow" on the same topic.

6. **How-to needs clear steps:** Don't just explain what to do—break it into actionable steps they can follow immediately.

7. **Demographic-specific content resonates:** "{demographic} guide to {topic}" signals you understand their unique situation. Use audience directive keywords.

8. **Save-worthy content wins:** Educational content should be reference material they'll return to. Checklists, timelines, and step-by-step guides get saved.

9. **Combine with global hooks:** Layer educational templates with curiosity formats. Example: "The {number} things nobody tells you about {topic}" combines list format with insider knowledge positioning.

10. **Avoid being preachy:** Teach, don't lecture. Share, don't prescribe. The best educational content feels like advice from a knowledgeable friend, not a classroom.
