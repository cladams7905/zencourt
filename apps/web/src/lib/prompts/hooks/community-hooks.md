## Usage Guidelines

1. **Be genuinely local:** This content only works if you actually know the area. Generic "best restaurants in {city}" content is obvious and damages credibility. Specificity is everything.

2. **Show, don't just list:** "The best brunch spots" is fine, but "Where I take out-of-town guests" implies personal experience and insider knowledge.

3. **Connect lifestyle to real estate:** The goal is positioning as a local expert who helps people buy into a lifestyle, not just a house. Every community post should make viewers want to live there.

4. **Seasonal relevance matters:** "The four seasons in {city}" works year-round, but "{number} trails you need to hike" hits harder in spring/fall. Time your content.

5. **Community content is high-value:** Events, local spots, and day-to-day lifestyle content build trust without steering.

6. **Food content performs:** Restaurant recommendations are universally engaging and shareable. They also signal local knowledge better than almost anything else.

7. **Avoid tourist-brochure tone:** "Visit beautiful {city}!" is cringe. "I'm biased, but {city} is the best place to live" is authentic. Write like a proud local, not a chamber of commerce.

8. **Tag local businesses:** When featuring restaurants, coffee shops, or local spots, tagging them can expand reach and build community relationships.

9. **Use for relocator content:** Community hooks are especially powerful for the Relocators & Job Transferees segment. They need to fall in love with the place, not just find a house.

10. **Combine with listing content:** "This home is 5 minutes from [featured trail/restaurant/park]" connects property to lifestyle. Use community content to enhance listing promotion.
