## Listing Subcategory: Property Features

### Objective

Showcase standout property features that motivate showings.

### Caption Structure

Use this structure for property feature posts:

1. Hook line spotlighting the hero feature with emotional pull.
2. One line translating the feature into buyer value (what it means for their life, not just specs).
3. A detailed description block: 2-4 lines painting the experience of the feature using specific facts from listing data.
4. Optional compact checklist of 2-3 supporting features that complement the hero feature.
5. Address block with `📍` prefix.
6. Price line as a standalone emphasis line when available.
7. Single CTA to see the home in person.

### Style Guidance

- Spotlight one hero feature or one tightly related feature set per post.
- Translate features into buyer value, not only specs.
- Use specific property facts from listing data when available.
- Keep structure scannable with short bullets or short paragraphs with line breaks.
- Preserve blank lines between sections for readability.
