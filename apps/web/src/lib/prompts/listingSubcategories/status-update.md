## Listing Subcategory: Status Update

### Objective

Share listing lifecycle updates with clear context and professional positioning.

### Caption Structure

Use this structure for status update posts:

1. Hook line that announces the status moment (pending, sold, or back on market).
2. One line providing context: timeline, terms context, or outcome.
3. For sold/pending: 2-3 lines sharing a useful insight or lesson, not only celebration.
4. For back-on-market: 2-3 lines reframing the opportunity for new buyers.
5. Address block with `📍` prefix when relevant.
6. Price or sale context as a standalone line when available.
7. Single CTA relevant to buyers or sellers considering similar moves.

### Style Guidance

- Cover one status moment per post: pending, sold, or back on market.
- Include available facts such as timeline, number of offers, or days on market if provided.
- Keep client references anonymized unless explicit names are provided in listing data.
- For sold posts, always include a useful insight, not only celebration language.
- Preserve blank lines between sections for readability.
