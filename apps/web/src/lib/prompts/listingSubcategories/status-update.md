## Listing Subcategory: Status Update

### Objective

Share listing lifecycle updates with clear context and professional positioning.

### Required Direction

- Cover one status moment per post: pending, sold, or back on market.
- Include available facts such as timeline, terms context, or seller outcome if provided.
- Keep client references anonymized unless explicit names are provided.
- For sold posts, include a useful insight, not only celebration language.
- End with a CTA relevant to buyers or sellers considering similar moves.
