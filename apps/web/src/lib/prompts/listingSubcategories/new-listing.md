## Listing Subcategory: New Listing

### Objective

Launch a new listing with high specificity and clear value.

### Required Direction

- Prioritize the property address in visual hierarchy when available: use it as a main header or first-slide header with an `📍` emoji whenever it fits naturally; otherwise include it as a concise subheader-style line (for example in supporting overlay text).
- Use a short value checklist style for key features of the property.
- Add one direct next step CTA, for example DM for details or schedule a tour.
