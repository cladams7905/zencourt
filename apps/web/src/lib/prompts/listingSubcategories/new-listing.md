## Listing Subcategory: New Listing

### Objective

Launch a new listing with high specificity and clear value.

### Caption Structure

Use this structure for new listing posts when facts are available:

1. Hook line that leads with a buyer tension or desire, then tie it to the listing.
2. One short context line about the opportunity in plain language.
3. A compact checklist with one fact per line (4-6 lines when enough facts exist), each prefixed with a bullet or emoji.
   - Prioritize facts in this order: beds, baths, year/type, standout interior or exterior feature, lot size.
4. Address block prefixed with `📍`, then city/state/zip on the next line.
5. Price line as a standalone emphasis line.
6. Single CTA line: DM for details, schedule a tour, or similar direct next step.

### Style Guidance

- Prioritize the property address in visual hierarchy: use it as a main header or first-slide header with `📍` whenever it fits naturally.
- Keep each line short and skimmable.
- Preserve blank lines between sections.
- Prefer concrete facts over adjectives.
- Use light excitement, not hype.
