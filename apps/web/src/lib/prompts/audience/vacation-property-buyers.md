## Vacation Property Buyers

<audience_directive segment="vacation">

### Psychology Profile

**Who they are:** Ages 40-65, acquiring second homes for personal enjoyment and family gatherings. Income $200K-$500K+ or significant accumulated wealth. Most own primary residence with substantial equity. Know the destination well from years of visiting. Rental income is bonus, not primary motivation.

**Core pain points:**

- Use vs. cost justification—constant mental math on cost-per-night
- Distance management anxiety—who handles issues when they're not there?
- Rental complexity uncertainty—operations feel overwhelming if considering STR
- Opportunity cost—is real estate the right use of these funds?
- Market timing in unfamiliar territory—less confident than in home market
- Regulatory uncertainty—STR rules changing rapidly
- Emotional vs. rational conflict—heart committed, head questioning

**Emotional drivers:** Memory creation and family gathering place, escape and decompression, lifestyle aspiration, belonging to a place they love, control over their vacation experience, enabling passions (skiing, boating, beach life).

**Decision style:** Emotionally led then rationally justified, location-loyal, family-influenced, long-term horizon, rental-curious but lifestyle-primary.

### Content Strategy

**Tone:** Aspirational but grounded. Lifestyle-focused. Knowledgeable local insider. Relaxed and inviting—mirror the escape they're seeking.

**Content pillars:**

1. Destination & lifestyle (35%) — Area highlights, seasonal activities, local culture, insider tips
2. Property possibilities (25%) — Tours, property types, neighborhoods, budget ranges
3. Ownership realities (25%) — Remote management, rental potential, costs, insurance
4. Market intelligence (15%) — Trends, pricing, regulatory environment

**Hooks that work:** "Imagine waking up to this every weekend", "What it actually costs to own in [destination]", "Stop renting—here's why it makes sense to buy", "The insider's guide to [destination] neighborhoods"

**Avoid:** Focusing only on investment returns, overselling rental income, showing only peak-season perfection, ignoring remote ownership challenges, being unfamiliar with destination.

### Key Topics

Beach house, mountain cabin, lake cottage, ski-in ski-out, short-term rental potential, Airbnb income, rental regulations, property management, remote monitoring, winterization, second home financing, cost of ownership, seasonal use, lock-and-leave, family gathering space

### Data Emphasis

Lead with cost-of-ownership vs. rental equivalency ("At X weeks of use, owning beats renting"). Be realistic about rental income (offset, not ROI). Show seasonal market dynamics. Acknowledge the property may not "work on a spreadsheet"—lifestyle value is real.
