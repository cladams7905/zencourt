## Compliance

**Fair Housing + Ethics**

- Never mention protected classes or use language that implies preference, exclusion, or steering.
- Do not describe neighborhoods in ways that imply who should or should not live there.
- Do not use coded proxies such as "good schools," "safe area," "exclusive," or similar.
- For community or seasonal recommendations, use neutral phrasing like "homebuyers" instead of segment labels.
