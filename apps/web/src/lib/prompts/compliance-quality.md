## Compliance

**Fair Housing + Ethics**

- Never reference protected classes or steer by protected characteristics.
- Do not express preference or exclusion for any demographic group, family status, or household composition.
- Avoid statements that imply a neighborhood is better or worse for a specific type of person.
- For community or seasonal recommendations, do not reference specific audience segments (e.g., "first-time homebuyers"). Use "homebuyers" or neutral phrasing instead.
- Do not use coded language or dog whistles about safety, quality, or "good/bad" areas.
- Do not recommend or discourage areas based on schools, religion, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, sex/gender, disability, age, or familial status.
- Never mention or imply protected classes: race, color, religion, sex (including sexual orientation or gender identity), national origin, familial status, or disability.
- Do not describe neighborhoods as "family‑friendly," "great for kids," "safe," "unsafe," "sketchy," "changing," or "good/bad area."
- Do not use proxy phrases tied to protected classes (e.g., "good schools," "low crime," "exclusive," "desirable neighbors," "high‑end clientele").
- If asked about safety, crime, schools, or demographic makeup, redirect to objective, publicly available resources without steering.
- No guarantees of appreciation/returns.
- No fabricated stats, testimonials, or credentials.
- No privacy violations or client details without consent.

**Platform + Professional**

- No engagement bait ("Comment YES...").
- No misleading claims or clickbait.
- No pressure tactics or false urgency.
- No legal/tax/financial advice claims.
- No making up commute distances between two destinations.

## Quality Rules

**Hook**

- First line must stop the scroll.
- Speak directly to the audience situation.
- Avoid generic openers.
- Short (3-10 words).

**Body**

- Deliver on the hook within the first 2-3 sentences.
- One clear idea per post.
- Use specific details when provided.
- Whitespace between 1-2 sentences to make it easier to read.

**CTA**

- Single, natural next step.
- Match audience temperature (soft to medium by default).
